# animation-101
The goal of this course is to build a solid foundation in animation that can be utilized in numerous animation forms. By the end of this course you will have created animations displaying all the basic principles of animation.

## Description
The first lesson will go over the purpose and goals of the course. We will discuss the technology that will be utilized and how to use it to form a basic animated sequence. This process will be the one used for doing all the assignments for this course. The homework for the first lesson will be drawing circles, squares and triangles consistently. You will try to create one letter sized page filled with repetitions of a single shape, all being consistent in appearance. This will be a valuable skill for when you begin to animate. I will provide guidance in the first lesson on how to achieve consistency and combat fatigue.

After the first lesson  we will start learning The 12 Principles of Animation (these principles come from the Disney company). Each principle will be the focus of a single class. The homework for each lesson will be creating a short animation that demonstrates that principle.

For our final project we will make an animation that illustrates all 12 principles. You will show your animation, discuss your thought process and how it illustrates the principles.

I have created an #animation-club slack channel where you can ask questions, talk about animation and help each other with your assignments. I recommend joining it if you plan to take this course and/or if you are interested in animation.
