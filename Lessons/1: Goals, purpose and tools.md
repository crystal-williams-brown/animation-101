## Purpose:

The purpose of the 12 principles of animation is to lead to consistent quality animation. It aids in conveying motion in a believable way and builds a foundational understanding of physics. Thus allowing reliable creation of pleasing animations.

These principles can be applied to different types of animation including web animation.

## Goals:

Our goal is to have created 13 animations, the first 12 of which will highlight a different principle and the last will display all principles of animation.

## Tools:

We will be making web animations for this class using CSS. You will do your assignments in [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/) and show them to the class.

## Assignment

#### Context:
Consistency is a vital part of animation. Because of this we will focus on creating consistent shapes for our first assignment. This is very important for hand drawn animation, storyboards, character design, and layout sketches.

The key to consistent shapes is using your full arm rather than your wrist to draw, and practicing. Using a larger muscle group will help steady your motion and reduce fatigue. Be sure not to hold your writing implement too tightly, itâ€™s better to use a loose/gentle grip.

#### Requirements:
For each of the following shapes fill a single letter sized sheet of paper with rows of consistent drawings of it. The repetitions of the same shape should be visibly close to the same size and overall look.
- Circle
- Square
- Triangle
