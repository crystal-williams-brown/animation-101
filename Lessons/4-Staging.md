## Staging:

Let us set the stage. The context of your animation effects the impact that it has. Why is this animation happening? How does it effect the world? These questions are answered by staging.

A bouncing circle is somewhat interesting but meaningless. But you put that circle inside the eye of a character, then it tells a story. It can become humorous if it's a kitten watching a item it wants, motivational if it's a child practicing dribbling, etc. To set the stage we should first think of what we are hoping our audience feels and/or learns. What's the story we want to tell?

For my example I'm going to be using the arc principle. I animate an triangle moving in an arc. This is a fine animation but meaningless. I add a room with birthday decorations and the triangle becomes a party hat worn by an invisible being. A ghost perhaps is celebrating another birthday.

## Assignment
Set the scene. Think of a context for your animation that gives it deeper meaning. Feel free to use an animation you already made and add context to it.


#### Requirements:
Setup a code pen with an animation placed in context that grants it more meaning.
