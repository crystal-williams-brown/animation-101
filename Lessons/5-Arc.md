## Arc:

We see arcs in the way jointed limps move, the way trees sway in wind, in the rise and set of the sun, etc. Arc is the result of having an anchor at one point and and opposite point being able to move within the restrictions of that anchor and being fairly ridged so as not to fold.

For this principle we will anchor our object, the anchor can be anything. I decided my anchor was a head on which my object was placed. The arc is constrained by being worn as a hat. It is following the arc of the head/neck which is constrained by its connection to the torso.

In CSS we can use the animation and transformation attribute. You can set the translate and rotate to effect the arc. Often a object rotates a bit during it's arc.

## Assignment
You will be animating a shape moving in an arc. The way the arc plays out will depend on the object and its anchor. Pick the anchor, object and animate the arc accordingly.


#### Requirements:
Setup a code pen and animate a shape moving in an arc.
