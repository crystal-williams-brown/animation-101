## Slow In, Slow Out:

While some things move at a continuious speed there are many things that adjust speed due to resistance. We have wind, gravity or even the structure of our body that changes the speed of our actions. The timing adjusts, speeding up and slowing down. This adjustment feels natural and can help your animation be more appealing as well as realistic. Often consistent speed is assocated with inorganic things such as machinary. It has it's place. But to create a friendly, human feel it is common to use timing changes even for machines.

## Assignment
You will be animating a shape moving and show the difference between ramping up it's speed (slow in) and ramping down it's speed (slow out)


#### Requirements:
Setup a code pen and make 2 versions of the shape. Have each one use a different timing (slow in, slow out).

Here is the link to my Code Pen where I animated different timings
